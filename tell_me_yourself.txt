Hello, my name is Liga Zinberga. I’m from Latvia and currently living in Germany.

Right now, I’m studying IT, web design, and programming. I’ve already completed many school projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Linux. I really enjoy building websites and solving tasks on GitHub.

In the past, I also worked in areas like sewing, cooking, and healthcare. I speak English, Latvian, and Russian. My German is basic, but I’m improving it.

Soon I plan to move to Malta and I’m looking for new opportunities — especially remote internships or teamwork in the IT field. I am hardworking, organized, and always willing to learn and help others.

Thank you very much!
